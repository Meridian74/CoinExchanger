# coinexchanger

I used Microsoft VS Code for developing this project.

The task:

Change (replace) the amount into the minimum pieces of given coins.

For example: coins are {1,5,7,9,11} and amount is 25. Returned correct answer is 3. Because you can change 25 into --> 2*coin<9> and 1*coin<7> or
--> 1*coin<11> and 2*coin<7> or 
--> 1*coin<11> and 1*coin<9> and and coin<5>.
Minimum pieces of coin: 3.

Optional task: show the list of all correct variations.
